### Super Globals
https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.variables.superglobals.php

Several predefined variables in PHP are "super-globals", which means they are available in all scopes throughout a script. There is no need to do global $variable; to access them within functions or methods.

        $GLOBALS
        $_SERVER
        $_GET
        $_POST
        $_FILES
        $_COOKIE
        $_SESSION
        $_REQUEST
        $_ENV
